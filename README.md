About the note and the Source code of the excise.

## Data Structure Study
### Professor: **Chenhao**

### ReferenceBook :
    Introduction to Algorithms (3rd)

    Algorithms (4th)

    Data Structure and Algorithms Analysis in C++(3rd)

    C++ Primer(5th)

    Elementary Algorithm
### Todo List:
    I will push all of my note and source code to the repository.
    The note include reading note and lesson note.
    The source code include the implementation of the algorithm written in the
    book and algorithm which are told in the class. Another is  I will collect
    some of the problems which will use the algorithms we had learned.

### No homework will be put in this repository.
